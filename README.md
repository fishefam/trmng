- 👋 Hi, My name's Truong.
- 👀 I am currently a student at Mohawk College, Hamilton, ON.
- 🌱 Learning how to code is fun and it keeps me proactive.
- 💞️ I would love to explore and see the awesome work of people so I can expand my narrowed knowledge.
- 📫 If there is something from my repos that might interest you to collab with me, please send me some DMs.
